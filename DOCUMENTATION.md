## Challenges and Solutions

### 1. Canvas State Management
**Challenge**: Managing complex drawing state and history.
**Solution**: Implemented a custom state management system using React's useState and useEffect hooks, with separate stacks for undo/redo functionality.

### 2. Real-time Preview
**Challenge**: Providing smooth preview for shapes while drawing.
**Solution**: Used a combination of canvas clearing and redrawing from history state to show live preview without affecting the final result.

### 3. Text Input Handling
**Challenge**: Implementing direct text input on canvas.
**Solution**: Created an overlay div for text input that converts to canvas drawing on completion.

### 4. Tool State Coordination
**Challenge**: Coordinating different tool behaviors and states.
**Solution**: Implemented a tool-type system with specific handlers for each tool type.

## Technical Insights

### Canvas Performance
- Used requestAnimationFrame for smooth drawing
- Implemented efficient history management
- Optimized redraw operations

### State Management
- Used local state for immediate updates
- Implemented history stack for undo/redo
- Used localStorage for persistence

### Component Architecture
Followed a modular approach:
- Separate components for tools
- Isolated canvas logic
- Reusable utility functions
